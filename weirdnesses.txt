Given discrepancies between the versions, 2P is favored for piano part and FS is favored for other parts. Due to significant differences from 2P and FS, MS is not given much editorial weight.
Miscellaneous dynamic and beaming adjustments are made for consistency.
[Elements in brackets] and dashed lines are editorial (inferred from context or from FS/MS).

Oboe: MS has part labeled for Clarinet in Bb, with Saxophone label crossed out.
Bassoons: MS has 1 bassoon.
Trumpet: MS has part for Trumpet in C.
FS has many additional dynamic markings in comparison to MS.

General
-------
I-93: An f from each of the dynamics is crossed out in FS, making it 1 level lower than 2P.
II-39: Rall is at beat 1 in FS, beat 2 in 2P.
III-57: Using (p) in place of p that has been placed on some parts seemingly arbitrarily.

Flutes
------
I-3, 103: Trill extends over sixteenth note on beat 3 in FS, but seems unlikely to be intended because of lack of tie. Trill does not extend to this note in MS, and at 49
I-10: Flute 1 has no explicit mf, assuming from Flute 2
I-22.4.5, 122.4.5: Flute I has D in FS, C# in MS
I-53: Hairpin is before this group of notes in FS, under the group of notes in MS.
I-113,114: Making beaming consistent with 13/MS.
III-28: Similar run at 200 has Eb marked. It seems likely that C and F should be naturals.
III-91: Slur extends to end of system, but no leading slur in next system
III-205,206: Trills are split at 206 in FS, continuous in MS. Combined with missing natural on C for Flute 2 in FS at 206, trills likely intended to be continuous.

Oboe
----
I-112,113: Trill split unlikely to be intended, continuous in MS
III-12: f has added in second hand in FS. Should likely be ff like other parts. ff in MS.
III-207.5: C# should likely be D. D in MS

Bassoons
--------
I-23-34: Bassoon solo only in MS and 2P
III-2: Staccato that no other part has and which is not elsewhere in the bassoon part
III-18: F# is erroneously E in FS

Horns
-----
I-104: Adding staccatos
II-3,4: Trailing slur at end of measure 3, but slur does not lead from previous system at measure 4 in FS. Slur only over measure 4 in MS.
III-195,196: Split trill unlikely to be intended

Trumpet
-------
I-58: Last sixteenth has natural on E instead of flat in FS
I-107: Slur between A and D unlikely to be intended. Similar section at measure 6 does not have a slur.
III-60.3: Concert G in FS and 2P, Gb in MS.
III-75-79: This part has been crossed out in FS. Is still present in MS and 2P.
III-106.6: Concert Gb in FS, flat seems drawn in second hand. G in 2P and MS,. G fits context better
III-107: Concert G in FS and MS, Gb in 2P. G fits context better
III-108: Concert Ab in FS, flat seems drawn in second hand. A in 2P and MS. A fits context better.
III-131: Concert F# in FS should be E.
III-131: See Timpani
III-171: Adding accent

Timpani
-------
I-9: Accent missing in FS. Present in MS
III-131: The hairpin here is aligned with the Trumpet dynamic but it seems more logically applied to Timpani.

Piano
-----
I-6: Upper D sixteenth notes are in MS and FS, but not 2P.
I-6-13: Dynamics only in FS
I-10: The higher octave is not present in FS, but it is in 2P and MS.
I-13: FS and MS have the F#5 eighth-note at beat 1, and a single F#6 sixteenth-note at beat 1.5. 2P has F#5 and F#6 sixteenth-note chord at beat 1.5. FS and MS have no accents. 2P is missing a # on the G in the left-hand voice.
I-15: 2P marked at pp, FS marked at p level with the strings
I-15-17: 2P doesn't have cresc. until 17.3.5
I-19: Top Ds in LH chords are in FS and MS but not in 2P. Beat 4.5 and G-F sixteenth notes in 2P and MS but not in FS. Beat 4.5 A eighth note only in 2P.
I-21.1.5: G3 in FS, A3 in 2P and MS. Similar section at 121 has A3, so this is likely an error.
I-21.2.5: FS missing A4. It is present at 21
I-25.1: Lowest note of LH chord is A in FS, B in 2P and MS
I-27: Hairpin only in 2P
I-27.4: G# in FS and MS where 2P has A.
I-28: Last 2 eighth notes at beat 4 in MS and FS, at beat 3.5 in 2P
I-29: 8va bassa only in 2P. f only in 2P l.v. ties only in MS.
I-30.3: C#3 in LH chord only in FS and MS.
I-31: Lowest C#1 of LH chord only in 2P
I-32.4: LH chord only in 2P
I-33: pp only in FS and MS. Hairpin only in FS.
I-35: Last RH eighth note in 2P is the continutation of the sixteenth note pattern in FS and MS.
I-38.2: Flat missing on Eb in FS.
I-40-42: Upper octave of LH only in 2P
I-64.4.5: Top note A4 of LH chord missing in FS
I-70.4.5: C# is dotted quarter note without reiterated eighth note in FS and MS
I-71.3.75: G missing in FS
I-75: B only in 2P
I-89.1.75: This is marked as D# in 2P, but D with explicit natural in FS and MS. Flutes play D natural nearby
I-92: Hairpin only in FS
I-92.4.5: Missing natural on B in FS
I-95: 8va bassa only in 2P
I-97.3: Missing in FS
I-119: Cue notes based on similar section at 19. FS is missing the D at 1.5. Only MS has the D at 4.5
I-121: Using the same voice-note distribution as 21
I-121.3.5: FS missing E. It is present at 21
II-12.3: FS missing E
II-24: Missing lower octave of C in FS
II-27: Missing natural on F in 2P and MS in RH
II-29.3: The RH in FS has quarter A3 and E4 with sole D4 at 3.5. 2P and MS have A+E -> A+D as eighth notes.
III-1,4,5: The quarter notes in 2P and MS are written as eighths in FS
III-16.5: The E in the LH chord is a D in MS as in the previous measure
III-25: f in 2P, FF is FS
III-29: ff only in FS
III-38,39: FS has inconsistenties in the pattern, likely mistakes. D4+C#5 instead of D4 at 38.1.5, 39.1.5, and 39.3.5. C#5 instead of D4 at 38.3.5.
III-44.4: Quarter note in 2P, eighth note in FS and MS
III-51.3: Natural on C missing in 2P
III-52.3: FS has C5 where 2P and MS have A4, likely an error
III-53.5-54: FS written an octave too high. (2P has 8va bassa on a treble clef to show the correct octave)
III-61: FS has Eb whereas 2P and MS have E explicitly marked natural. E matches horns and Violins II.
III-71: The trill starts at beat 4 in FS, beat 2 in 2P
III-74: Natural on F missing in FS.
III-74: A4 instead of G4 in FS and MS. Based on general motivic shapes, it is likely an error in 2P.
III-79.6: Additional G4 in FS and MS. MS additionally has a D4 here. Based on similar measure at 17, these should both be included.
III-80.1: Additional E3 in FS and MS. Based on similar measure 18, it is likely an error in 2P.
III-80.6: A4 instead of G4 in FS and MS. Based on similar measure 18, it is likely an error in 2P.
III-83.6: Natural missing on F in FS.
III-86.6.5: Should likely be Cn instead of C# but no source has a natural on this note.
III-98.3.5: Marked F natural in FS, but no accidental in 2P or MS, so this is likely an error.
III-99: The RH triad is Cn+E+Gn in 2P, Cn+E#+G in FS, Cn+E+G# in MS. Based on context, MS is correct.
III-101-102: Compared to 2P, MS is missing octave starting with G4 from 101.5-102.1; FS is missing the octave starting with G5 from 101.5 to 102.6.
III-105: FS has Eb whereas 2P and MS E explicitly marked natural.
III-106.5: G4 in FS and MS, F4 in 2P. Violins II have F4 and similar measure at 58 is in unison with Violins II so G4 is likely an error.
III-111: All parallel major chords in FS and MS. No # on E on beat 1, F marked natural on beat 2, and no # on A on beat 3 breaks this pattern in 2P, so these are likely errors.
III-114: Middle voice missing in second half of measure in FS
III-133,134: Based on missing natural on C at beat 134.3 in 2P, an C with a natural at 134.1 was likely intended. No Cs in LH in MS. No Cs in measure 134 in LH in FS.
III-133-171: Numerous differences in cadenza
III-161.2: Flat is written on D instead of Bb
III-168-169: Measures are empty (no rests) in FS. Likely the chords were mistakenly left out
III-189: No E4 in FS
III-199: En4s in 2P. Eb4s in FS. MS is illegible. Violas have En4. Similar measure at 27 has En in all.
III-207.3: D4 missing in FS.

Violins I
---------
III-105: FS has Eb instead of E whereas 2P and MS E explicitly marked natural. Eb is more harmonious.
III-106: Missing flat on Ab based on 2P and context

Violins II
----------
I-56,57: Normalizing articulation with Violas
III-106.4: 2P has Gb here instead of G, but horns have D (concert G)
III-203: Last 2 notes have accents instead of staccatos

Violas
------
III-8: 2nd chord has G+D, likely supposed to be A+D
III-35-41, 207-214: Trill split at each measure. Likely supposed to be continuous trill
III-179: Marked div. but seems unlikely. The similar section at 7 is not marked div. with brackets suggesting non div. In addition after the system break at 181, there is a bracket suggesting non div.
III-196: Trailing slur, but no leading slur on next system. Next set of notes is slurred, so slur unlikely
III-214: Half note instead of dotted quarter note

Cellos
------
II-35: These is a slur over these notes in the MS and 2P but not in FS.
III-76: The chord should potentially be on beat 4 instead of 5 like the surrounding measures, but the writing in FS shows no sign it may be an error. This section is not included in 2P and the section in MS is too dissimilar to be any indication.

Basses
------
II-35: These is a slur over these notes in the MS and 2P but not in FS.
III-44: Adding accent based on surroundings
III-49: Adding col legno like other strings and like 97
III-179-183: Adding stacactos
III-187: Adding accent based on surroundings

Movement I
----------------------------------------------
Tempo Marking: FS has Vif (q = 144), MS has Allegro Moderato (no metronome marking), and 2P has Allegro (no metronome marking).
3, Flute, Piano: 
Measure 11, Trumpet: MS has different melody. Part excluded from 2P.
Measure 13, Trumpet: No source has dynamic specified. Assumed from context.
Measure 13, Timpani: Tacet here in MS.
Measure 13, Piano:  Cross-staff movement has been removed and replaced with clef changes by preference.
Measure 17+, Oboe, Flute, Strings: Slurring pattern inconsistent between MS and FS.
Measure 19, Piano: Bracketed Ds not in 2P.
Measure 21, Piano: Inconsistency in the notes of the accented upstem chords. The accented chords in MS share the beam with the downstem melody. They are G3-D-G-A, A3-D-E-G-A, A3-D-C#-E-F-A, and A3-D-E-A. In FS, there are no accents. 
Measure 22, Piano: Third left-hand chord is G-D-G in 2P instead of G-D-A in FS and MS.
Measure 23, Piano: First right-hand chord in MS is D-F#-D, in FS D-E-F#-D, in 2P D-F#-A-D. Beat 3, left hand has C#-E in MS and FS, has A-C# in 2P.
Measure 25, Piano: Beat 1 has A-F# in FS, B-F# in MS and 2P. Beat 2 has E in FS, D in 2P and MS. Beat 3 has additional A3 in 2P.
Measure 26, Piano:
Measure 27, Piano: Cresc. only in 2P
Measure 28, Piano:
Measure 29, Piano: Only 2P has forte marking, and 8ba, and C# in beat 4.5.
Measure 29-31, Woodwinds: Multiple Phrase Differences, 2P implies MS, recording plays FS
Measure 34-35, Trumpet: Sixteenth notes slurred in MS
Measure 34+, Strings: Different slurring
Measure 36, Piano: FS has different LH chords

Gave up specifically looking for discrepancies, copy from 2P and FS, unless something seemed suspicious

Movement II
------------------------------------------
Measure 20: MS and FS have lowest LH note in downbeats as all C#4, 2P has D4s there. Recording has C#4s.
